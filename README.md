# T2 Ubuntu Kernel

Ubuntu/Mint/Debian kernel with Apple T2 patches built-in. This repo will try to keep up with kernel new releases.

![Build Kernel Package](https://github.com/t2linux/T2-Ubuntu-Kernel/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=Mainline)

This project is closely inspired by mikeeq/mbp-fedora-kernel and marcosfad/mbp-ubuntu-kernel. Thank you @mikeeq and @marcosfad for the scripts and setup.

Special thanks to @Redecorating for the CI.

## Pre installation steps

Releases starting from 5.16.2 and 5.15.16 (LTS) or have apple-bce and apple-ibridge drivers built-into the kernel. Thus, you may remove the dkms versions of them by running :-

```
sudo rm -r /usr/src/apple-bce*
sudo rm -r /usr/src/apple-ibridge*
sudo rm -r /var/lib/dkms/apple-bce
sudo rm -r /var/lib/dkms/apple-ibridge
```

In case you have used an iso with kernel version **5.8.x or lower**, then the above steps are compulsory.

If you want to install an older kernel (i.e. older than 5.16.2 or 5.15.16 (LTS)), then follow the [DKMS Guide](http://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/dkms/) to uninstall old drivers and get new drivers for the kernels. It is required only once and must be done before installing a kernel from here.

## INSTALLATION

### The easy way

Download the .deb packages of **linux-headers** and **linux-image** of the kernel you wish to install from the [releases](https://github.com/t2linux/T2-Ubuntu-Kernel/releases) section.

Install **linux-headers** first and then **linux-image** using `apt` and restart your Mac. In case you do not know how to do so, follow the instructions given below. Else you are good to go.

On terminal, type `sudo apt install ` and then drag and drop the **linux-headers** file to the terminal and press enter/return key.

Do the similar process for **linux-images** package.

Restart your Mac.

### Building yourself

Clone the repo using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/t2linux/T2-Ubuntu-Kernel
```

Open a terminal window and run

```bash
cd T2-Ubuntu-Kernel
sudo ./build.sh
```

The kernel shall take around an hour to compile. After that you shall find three .deb packages in `/root/work`.

Install the **linux-headers** package first using `apt`. In case you do not know how to do so, follow the instructions described in the above **The easy way** section. Similarly install the **linux-image** package too.

Restart your Mac.

You may then delete the `/root/work` directory using `sudo rm -r /root/work` to free up space.
